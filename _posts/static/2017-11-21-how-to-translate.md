### I know a lof of languages

Great! You can help us translating the project. We are currently translating to Korean, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Russian, Japanese and more.

### But wait, I'm an expert in a different language

If you are an expert in a language we are not currently translating, you can request the new translation in Transifex and help us to reach more customers in their native language.

### Let's Translate

We use [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/) to translate our projects. To start contributing with translations you require an account and request to join the team of GLPI Project.

After you are accepted you can now go to the [GLPI Project organization](https://www.transifex.com/glpi/) where you'll see all the projects listed to your left and a graphic with the statistics of Source Strings translations.

Thank you for your contribution!
